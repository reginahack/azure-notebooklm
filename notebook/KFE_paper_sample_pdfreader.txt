The radioactivation of in-vessel components due to the fusion neutrons is an unavoidable trade-o ﬀin a tokamak
reactor. We investigate the radioactivity level of nuclides and decay heat of conceptual water-cooled ceramic
breeder blanket and divertor modules in K-DEMO, and demonstrate that a cooling scheme related to the decay
time is important to prevent thermal failure of those components due to decay heat during their maintenance.For K-DEMO with a fusion power of 2.2 GW, the activation levels of blankets and divertors are evaluatedregarding a regulatory low level limit in Korea. Total decay heat from radioactivated blankets and divertors
reaches 63.4 MW after the full power operation of two years. In an outboard module, immediately after the
plasma shutdown, local maximum temperature reaches 1300°C with the temperature di ﬀerence up to 840 °C
inside the module. Conservative natural convection was assumed to validate its integrity to remain within the
allowable temperature range of the materials used, when provided that the cool-down time is secured at least a
couple of days, the overall temperature of the module is reduced to about 200°C in 10 days. It is worth con-sideration that a forced convective scheme such an internal passage cooling can be tailored until a critical time
corresponding to con ﬁgurations of each module.
1. Introduction
It is necessary to manage the radioactivity of in-vessel components
at a low level and resulting decay heat against their radioactivation due
to fusion neutrons although absence of high-level radioactive waste is a
great advantage of nuclear fusion power [ 1–4]. It is foreseen that
subsequent decay heat generation from used in-vessel components,such as blankets and divertors, reaches up to tens of megawatt after theplasma shutdown [ 2,3,5,6]. During the maintenance involving the re-
placement of in-vessel components, the induced radionuclides, theirconcentration and decay heat restrict application conditions of remote
handling technology. Moreover the induced radioactivation character-
istics are critical determinants of disposal methods of the radio-acti-
vated components as radiowaste to be [ 7].
The issue in radioactivation is very important for the design of K-
DEMO, particularly for the safety of the reactor [ 8,9]. A preliminary
assessment has to be done to verify whether it can be handled withinthe scope of intermediate level radioactive waste in accordance with
related regulations. The compliance with the regulatory procedures will
lead to the optimization of maintenance technologies ( i.e., remote
handling) [ 10–12] not only to minimize the amount of radioactive
waste but also to maximize the availability of a fusion plant [ 3,13].In this study we aim to investigate the radioactive characteristics of
a conceptual water-cooled ceramic breeder blanket and a divertormodule in K-DEMO. The concentrations of activated nuclides from
blankets and divertors are evaluated, and subsequent decay heat is
estimated. Accounting for the decay heat analysis, we estimate their
thermal response of temperature distributions by 3-D heat transfer
analyses using ANSYS Fluent. We demonstrate that cool-down time of
components is a key factor in designing a cooling scheme. It is worthconsideration that an active cooling, which dissipates heat by a primary
heat transfer system passing through the in-vessel components, can be
tailored to ensure soundness of the components and optimize a main-
tenance scenario without their failure.
2. Speci ﬁcation of K-DEMO for the assessment of rad-waste
Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the conceptual K-DEMO tokamak
reactor equipped with water-cooled ceramic breeder blankets and di-
vertor modules [ 14–17]. The tokamak with a fusion power of 2.2 GW is
a double null with vertically symmetrical divertors, and has a majorradius ( R) of 6.8 m and minor radius ( a) of 4.2 m [ 18,19]. A breeding
blanket induces sustainable tritium breeding and neutron multi-plication through a reaction between neutrons emitted from fusion

plasma and materials of breeder and multiplier, respectively. The
water-cooled ceramic breeder blanket consists of a plasma facing layer
of tungsten, a structural material of reduced activation ferritic mar-
tensitic (RAFM) steel and pebble bed layers of Li 4SiO 4and Be 12Ti
contained in RAFM steel structures for the respective tritium breedingand neutron multiplication [ 15,20]. It is a modular component and
hundreds of the modules constitute tokamak inner wall [ 15]. A divertor
consists of tungsten mono-blocks, to ensure mechanical robustness
against high heat ﬂux, RAFM steel heat sinks and a cassette body with
internal
cooling passages [ 20–22]. In both models, internal cooling passages
are shaped for a pressurized water coolant [ 15,17,21,23]. Table 1
presents the weight of conceptual modules of K-DEMO blanket and
divertor components discharged at every replacements.
3. Assessment of radioactivation of in-vessel components
The neutron wall load (NWL) applied to plasma facing surfaces is
calculated for the fusion power of 2.2 GW. Local NWL on the ﬁrst wall
(FW) is estimated using a developed in-house code [ 24]. When the
geometric information is set ﬁrst, the plasma region, where is for the
plasma core and the scrape-o ﬀlayer (SOL), and the FW are to be seg-
mented. Then it calculates the quantity of the neutron load distribution
from each source ( i.e., plasma radiation and neutron) point to each
target segment on FW considering the solid angles. Fig. 2 shows NWL
applied to the in-vessel components in the poloidal direction. An
average NWL applied to the FW of the in-vessel components exceeds
1 MW/m
2, and FW of an equatorial outboard blanket is exposed to
2.83 MW/m2. Accounting for this pro ﬁle, we analyze the radio-
activation level and decay heat generation of the water-cooled ceramic
breeder blanket and divertor by an in-house code utilizing a nuclide
emission data library [ 25,26]. In the calculation process using this code,
it is assumed that the in-vessel components are exposed to the fusionneutrons irradiated from the reactor for 2 years. In addition the blanket
and the divertor components are handled as 1-D layered models asschematically presented in Fig. 3. In a blanket model a plasma facing W
layer, an adhesion layer of vanadium, RAFM steel structures and the
pebble beds are represented by a series of layer structures. The 1-D
divertor model describes tungsten mono-blocks, heat sinks made of
RAFM steel and a cassette body. Through
the neutron transport analysis using a Monte Carlo neutron particle
transport code (MCNP), the neutron ﬂux is derived to each layer in the
1-D model according to re ﬁned energy levels from 10
−10to 14.1 MeV
[20]. Then the degree of neutron ﬂux attenuation along the depth of the
modules is correlated as a function of position, and extrapolated onevery surfaces and cells constituting the model in terms of con ﬁgura-
tions ( i.e., shapes and materials) of each blanket and divertor. The
radioactivity and consequent decay heat characteristics are then
quantitatively derived as a function of time and position of each con-
stituent element of the structure [ 20]. Accounting for the decay heat
after plasma shutdown, the consequent thermal behaviors of the com-ponents are characterized by 3-D heat transfer analyses using an ANSYS
Fluent (v18.0) software under quasi-steady state conditions according
to the time increase.

can be stated the cooling time after plasma shutdown is a deterministic
factor of their radioactivity and a design parameter of maintenance
[13]. The activation levels of W in the blanket and divertor decrease in
time and become 3.16% and 3.50% in a year compared to their initialvalues, respectively. Fig. 5a shows activated nuclides from the tungsten
FW located in an equatorial outboard blanket where the highestradioactivation is predicted with NWL of 2.83 MW/m
2. In the graph,
baselines which speci ﬁes low level limit of rad-wastes in Korea are also
indicated [ 27]. Fig. 5(b) explains the classi ﬁcation of rad-waste and
corresponding disposal methods in Korea [ 13,27–29]. The rad-waste
should be handled in accordance with the regulation and be indicated
into the low level waste, which can be disposed of in shallow land
burial in the light of social and economic susceptibility of a fusion plant.
Considering the baselines, we con ﬁrm that long-half-life radionuclides
such as14C(t1/2= 5700 y),60Co ( t1/2= 5.27 y) and99Tc ( t1/
2= 2.1 × 105y) can be kept below their speci ﬁc baseline activity of
3.74 × 106, 3.02 × 1010and 1.41 × 105Bq/kg, respectively. The re-
sults demonstrate those noxious nuclides remains below the low level
limit. The replacement of the components and disposal must be per-
formed depending on the level of activity concentrations [ 26]. In other
words, the legitimate classi ﬁcation as shown in Fig. 5 b will be a
guideline for designing a maintenance period and a consequential dis-
posal method regarding the activation.
5. Assessment of decay heat for cooling design
For thermal analyses, a commercial computational ﬂuid dynamic
code of ANSYS Fluent (v18.0) was used as a solver. For the blanket and
divertor modules, 3-dimensional temperature on both blanket and di-
vertor modules was evaluated under a quasi-steady state condition.
Particularly on blanket models, preliminary mesh dependence were
checked, and structured meshes more than 1.9 million were used with
at least 7 layers in the thinnest structure. Natural convection excluding
other cooling schemes is assumed on the outmost surface of a target
module with heat transfer coe ﬃcient of 10 W/m2K for conservative
assessment of thermal reliability.
Fig. 6 shows the variation of decay heat from the in-vessel compo-
nents. Immediately after the plasma shutdown, the in- and outboardblanket and the divertor generate decay heat by 13.0, 42.1 and
8.34 MW, respectively. Total decay heat drastically decreases from 63.4
(att= 0 s) to 7.44 (11.0%), 3.16 (4.97%), 2.82 (4.44%) and 2.55 MW
(4.02%) as tincreases to 1, 7, 15 and 30 days, respectively. Consequent
local temperature is also evaluated to validate whether it would be
secured below their melting points. In case of a divertor ( Fig. 7(a)), the
maximum temperature of a divertor readily decreases with time; a se-parate divertor shows the highest temperature of 418.3, 336.6 and

216.3 °C in central-,
outboard- and inboard target, respectively. For the central part it
takes at least 3 days while overall temperature falls below 100 °C. In an
outboard blanket module ( Fig. 7(b)), decay heat leads to local tem-
perature increase over 1300 °C and spatial temperature di ﬀerence of
840 °C within a module. Otherwise, the natural convection without any
forced convective cooling can be valid only after the speci ﬁc cool-down
period of at least a couple of days; local maximum temperature in theblanket decreases to 220 °C and 180 °C with the time of 4 and 10 days,
respectively. These results demonstrate the cool-down time is important
in designing a maintenance scheme. Particularly in the speci ﬁc period
with high decay heat, the signi ﬁcant temperature di ﬀerence might lead
to unexpected failure due to consequent thermal stresses. In this regard,
an appropriate cooling scheme involving an active cooling through
internal passages of in-vessel components should be employed con-
sidering the transient thermal behaviors, which depend on con ﬁgura-
tions of each component.
It is important that each component should be as intact as possible,
and related facilities be prevented from being damaged due to thermal
failure induced by decay heat. In order to minimize the volume of
radioactive waste, an optimal maintenance scheme should be devised
through the reuse or recycling of materials used for the in-vessel
components. Furthermore, the decay heat should be regarded as a
primary source term deteriorating the safety of a DEMO system[8,30,31]. The conservative assessment on safety issues, assuming the
worst accidents, and sequential feedback on design will be the basis of
our future studies for the design of a reliable fusion plant.
6. Conclusion
The radioactivation of in-vessel components is inevitable in a fusion
tokamak reactor. In a design phase of a DEMO, the concentration of
radioactive nuclides and decay heat should be treated as factors de-
termining a replacement and subsequent disposal strategy of in-vessel
components. In this study we investigated the activation levels of water-
cooled ceramic breeder blankets and divertors in K-DEMO in respect to
a regulatory low level limit in Korea. We assessed decay heat genera-
tion; total decay heat from the in-vessel components reaches up to
63.4 MW after two years of the full power operation of a conceptual K-
DEMO with the target fusion power of 2.2 GW. It is worth consideration
that alternative cooling schemes involving an active cooling can be
tailored at the time when excessive decay heat occurs. The activation
characteristics will be further assessed for the global K-DEMO model,
and will be discussed to clarify design parameters of hot cell and related
maintenance scenarios [ 12]. The integrated decay heat results will also
be employed as prerequisites of a transient thermo-hydraulic analysisfor safety assessment of K-DEMO.
