        "text": "Absolutely, Jane. Fire away—hopefully not literally!"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Ha! Okay, fusion is called 'clean' nuclear energy. But is it really waste-free?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Great question. Fusion avoids the nastiest waste, but it’s not totally spotless."
    },

        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "So, what actually gets radioactive in a fusion reactor?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Mainly the parts inside the reactor—like blankets and divertors. Neutrons hit them hard."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Wait, so just being inside makes them radioactive?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Exactly. Those speedy neutrons slam into atoms, making some unstable—radioactive."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "And when you shut down the reactor, does all that radioactivity just... vanish?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "I wish! Even after shutdown, those atoms keep releasing energy—decay heat."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Decay heat... Is that like when your oven stays hot after baking cookies?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Perfect analogy! The reactor parts keep 'baking' for days, sometimes weeks."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "How hot are we talking? Like, could you roast marshmallows in there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Right after shutdown, some spots hit 1300°C. That’s hotter than lava!"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Whoa, okay, so definitely not s'mores territory. How do you cool things down?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "At first, we use active cooling—think water rushing through pipes."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Later, as it cools, we switch to natural convection—just air moving heat away."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "How long before it’s safe to, you know, open the door?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "It takes at least a couple of days to drop below 200°C. Patience is key!"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "And if you skip cooling, what’s the worst that could happen?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Without cooling, you risk cracks, warping—serious damage to the plant."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "So, cooling isn’t just for comfort. It’s about keeping the whole place safe."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Exactly. It’s a huge part of our safety planning and design."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "What about the waste? Where does it all go?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Most fusion waste is low-level. We can usually bury it in shallow land sites."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "That sounds way less scary than traditional nuclear waste."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "It is. Plus, we track long-lived isotopes to make sure it stays safe."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Can you recycle any of these radioactive parts?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "We’re working on it! Recycling and reusing materials is a big focus now."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "It sounds like a juggling act—safety, efficiency, and the environment."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "You nailed it. Every choice impacts safety, cost, and our planet."
    },

        "text": "What excites you most about the future of fusion safety?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Honestly, smarter designs—better materials, better cooling. It’s getting safer every year."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "So, fusion isn’t just about making energy. It’s about managing what we leave behind."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Exactly. Responsible waste and heat management are key for fusion’s future."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Dr. Kim, this was eye-opening. Thanks for making fusion a little less mysterious!"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "And listeners, next time you hear 'clean energy,' remember the science behind the scenes."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Host (Alice)",
        "text": "Thanks for tuning in to Science Unplugged. Stay curious, and see you next time!"
